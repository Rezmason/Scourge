RM: When will Haxe have => ?
RM: Like, by default?

MS: Doubt it will ever have =>
MS: NC is very resistant

RM: What about !+ ?

MS: What the fuck is !+

RM: Booleancrement.

MS: I have never in my life heard of that
MS: !+true //false?
MS: Oh
MS: wait
MS: 10 !+ true //11?

RM: No, trace(!+false); // not 11

MS: .. what?
MS: that makes no sense at all

RM: What do you mean?

MS: Give a real world example

RM: var n:Booleint = !+false;
    trace(n != 11); // true
RM: It's not eleven.
RM: What's ambiguous about that?

MS: That has absolutely no use case at all
MS: Zero

RM: :-/
RM: Last time I checked, there's roughly 2^32 - 1 integers that aren't eleven.
RM: AS3 already has this built in. if (val) expands to whether or not val == 0.

MS: Haxe does not do that on purpose

RM: Right, because it needs Booleints.

MS: No it doesn't
MS: if statements must always evaluate to a bool in haxe

RM: Look.

MS: For === safety

RM: What's the size of a Boolean?
RM: It's one bit, right? Optimally?

MS: No
MS: It's one byte

RM: Fine.

MS: at least for as3 afaik

RM: Now, if you have an integer,
RM: and it *isn't eleven,*
RM: wouldn't you benefit from storing an Int in a single byte?

MS: Are  you talking about a whole number, or an int
MS: an int is a whole number of a certain number of bits
MS: int is most commonly associated with 32 bits

RM: Right, but most of those bits represent which number the value *is*.
RM: How about the ones that represent which number it *isn't*?

MS: Yes.. not all the bits are set, I have no clue where you're going with this

RM: Off the deep end.
RM: I'm just joshing you, dude. (rofl)

MS: I can never tell if you're being serious

RM: It's a typo of != and I do it all the time.

MS: I need to drink.. a lot now

RM: How much?
RM: Not eleven?
RM: In a similar vein, Jon Kisor and I are going to do a spike sooner or later during which we'll investigate puns, write a formal description of "pun" and apply the concept to programming.

MS: I'm never talking to you again
MS: My mind can't take it anymore

RM: I believe that that is impossible.
RM: Or an amazing achievement.

MS: I can't fucking believe I just got trolled

RM: :D Booleancrement!
RM: Hey, have you heard of the xx operator?
RM: trace(val xx); // poop
RM: It's called excrement.
