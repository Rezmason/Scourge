This is a HaXe port of the awesome Ash entity component framework by Richard Lord (http://www.ashframework.org/).
It leverages HaXe's great cross-platform portability and runs on Flash, JavaScript, C++, Android, iOS and so on.
Also it uses much static typing features of HaXe, allowing more mistakes to be detected at compile time instead
of runtime than in original ActionScript 3 version.

Note that this is currently PRE-ALPHA quality software to be modified without any compatibility concerns.

Check out original Ash website for great articles on entity frameworks and game development.
