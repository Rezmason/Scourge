{"name":"Scourge","tagline":"A Haxe-based adaptation of the classic Mac game, Fungus.","body":"Scourge\r\n=======\r\n**( Single Celled Organisms Undergo Rapid Growth Enhancement )**\r\n\r\n[Quick link to the 2010 prototype](http://www.rezmason.net/scourge/?numPlayers=2)\r\n\r\nScourge is a derivative of [Fungus](http://www.info-mac.org/viewtopic.php?t=4644), a game produced by [Ryan Koopmans](http://www.e-brains.com/) with [Jason Whong](http://jason.whong.org/) in 1992. Its core game mechanics are reminiscent of the rules of Go, Reversi, Tetris and Blokus. It is a fun and ruthless game that builds players' resolve and strains their friendships.\r\n\r\nScourge is written in [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/), a highly versatile language that can compile to many, many platforms.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Scourge is currently built with Haxe 3 RC and Git-hosted haxelibs. Consequently it may be difficult to configure your build environment to build both Scourge and Haxe 2 projects easily.**\r\n\r\nScourge is written on top of a framework called the ROPES, which I'm developing simultaneously. While the ROPES primarily must support Scourge, it is designed to support the development of all sorts of turn-based games. At some point after Scourge is up and running, the ROPES will receive the attention it needs to stand alone as a separate project.\r\n\r\n# Project Goals\r\n\r\nI intend to achieve several things with this project:\r\n\r\n+ Create a game with the same mechanics and gameplay on all platforms targetable by [NME](http://www.haxenme.org/)\r\n+ Structure the development of the game with a unit testing framework (in this case, [MassiveUnit](https://github.com/massiveinteractive/MassiveUnit)... stop giggling)\r\n+ Create a game framework called the ROPES that can be used to represent a large number of turn-based games\r\n+ Ressurect the Fungus game variety, and expand on it with new and compelling game mechanics\r\n+ Tell a compelling story with non-human characters\r\n+ Release a game that costs money, but whose [source code is freely accessible](http://www.fsf.org/)\r\n+ Write computer opponenets of various types\r\n+ Create a game view that is based on OpenGL-style graphics APIs on multiple platforms\r\n+ Create a game whose rules may be highly configurable at runtime\r\n+ Implement multiplayer game support across all platforms, including chat support and multiplayer game configuration\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you have an interest in this project, please [contact me](mailto:jeremysachs@rezmason.net).\r\n\r\n# Legal?\r\n\r\nThe source for Scourge and the ROPES is released under the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nScourge and the Ropes are trademarks of Jeremy Sachs.
