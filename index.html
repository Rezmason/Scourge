        <h1>Scourge</h1>

<p><strong>( Single Celled Organisms Undergo Rapid Growth Enhancement )</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rezmason.net/scourge/?numPlayers=2">Quick link to the 2010 prototype</a></p>

<p>Scourge is a derivative of <a href="http://www.info-mac.org/viewtopic.php?t=4644">Fungus</a>, a game produced by <a href="http://www.e-brains.com/">Ryan Koopmans</a> with <a href="http://jason.whong.org/">Jason Whong</a> in 1992. Its core game mechanics are reminiscent of the rules of Go, Reversi, Tetris and Blokus. It is a fun and ruthless game that builds players' resolve and strains their friendships.</p>

<p>Scourge is written in <a href="http://www.haxe.org/">Haxe</a>, a highly versatile language that can compile to many, many platforms.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Scourge is currently built with Haxe 3 RC and Git-hosted haxelibs. Consequently it may be difficult to configure your build environment to build both Scourge and Haxe 2 projects easily.</strong></p>

<p>Scourge is written on top of a framework called the ROPES, which I'm developing simultaneously. While the ROPES primarily must support Scourge, it is designed to support the development of all sorts of turn-based games. At some point after Scourge is up and running, the ROPES will receive the attention it needs to stand alone as a separate project.</p>

<h1>Project Goals</h1>

<p>I intend to achieve several things with this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a game with the same mechanics and gameplay on all platforms targetable by <a href="http://www.haxenme.org/">NME</a>
</li>
<li>Structure the development of the game with a unit testing framework (in this case, <a href="https://github.com/massiveinteractive/MassiveUnit">MassiveUnit</a>... stop giggling)</li>
<li>Create a game framework called the ROPES that can be used to represent a large number of turn-based games</li>
<li>Ressurect the Fungus game variety, and expand on it with new and compelling game mechanics</li>
<li>Tell a compelling story with non-human characters</li>
<li>Release a game that costs money, but whose <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">source code is freely accessible</a>
</li>
<li>Write computer opponenets of various types</li>
<li>Create a game view that is based on OpenGL-style graphics APIs on multiple platforms</li>
<li>Create a game whose rules may be highly configurable at runtime</li>
<li>Implement multiplayer game support across all platforms, including chat support and multiplayer game configuration</li>
</ul><h1>Contributing</h1>
