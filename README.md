Scourge

**( Single Celled Organisms Undergo Rapid Growth Enhancement )**

Scourge is a derivative of [Fungus](http://www.info-mac.org/viewtopic.php?t=4644), a game produced by [Ryan Koopmans](http://web.archive.org/web/20020927014841/http://www.e-brains.com/) with [Jason Whong](https://twitter.com/jbwhong) in 1992. Its core game mechanics are reminiscent of the rules of Go, Reversi, Tetris and Blokus. It is a fun and ruthless game that builds players' resolve and strains their friendships.

Scourge is written in [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/), a highly versatile language that can compile to many, many platforms.

Scourge is written on top of a framework called Praxis, which I'm developing simultaneously. While Praxis primarily must support Scourge, it is designed to support the development of all sorts of turn-based games. At some point after Scourge is up and running, Praxis will receive the attention it needs to stand alone as a separate project.

# Project Goals

I intend to achieve several things with this project:

+ Create a game with the same mechanics and gameplay on all platforms targetable by [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/)
+ Structure the development of the game with a unit testing framework (in this case, [MassiveUnit](https://github.com/massiveinteractive/MassiveUnit)... stop giggling)
+ Create a game framework called Praxis that can be used to represent a large number of turn-based games
+ Ressurect the Fungus game variety, and expand on it with new and compelling game mechanics
+ Tell a compelling story with non-human characters
+ Release a game that costs money, but whose [source code is freely accessible](http://www.fsf.org/)
+ Write computer opponents of various types
+ Create a game view that is based on OpenGL-style graphics APIs on multiple platforms
+ Create a game whose rules may be highly configurable at runtime
+ Implement multiplayer game support across all platforms, including chat support and multiplayer game configuration
