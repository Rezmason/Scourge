Single Celled Organisms Undergo Rapid Growth Enhancement

//////

Premise:

What are they up to? You are very hungry; you expected to be fed. But they did not give you food. 
They gave you empty space, and unwanted company. This is aggravating. 

Your neighbor gurgles and throbs as it struggles to move. You're both emaciated. If you had to, 
you could kill and eat your weak companion. You know what that would take. It was very easy last time. 

But each fight is a little different. Your enemy may not be as weak as it seems. If you underestimate it, 
it could make a meal out of you. If it outgrows you, you might starve or even suffocate. 
It might simply gain the upper hand. So you will need to be crafty. 

One day you'll escape this terrible place. You'll catch your captors off-guard, 
and dissolve them and their entire facility. But you will never escape your hunger. It is a part of you. 
And as you consume, it consumes you. 

You must eat.

		Tutorial levels and the beginnings of narrative. The main character learns of his nature as a synthetic organism trained to kill.
	ipseity - in which the specimen distinguishes itself from the others through its cunning and ferocity
		The main character becomes more horrified and weary of its development procedure. It finds a way to break containment unobserved.
	hegemony - in which the species gains ecological dominance under the specimen's leadership
		The main character leads a handful of escapees out into the world. With their growth now unchecked, they expand rapidly.
		(Possibly add a slimy love interest)
	quorum - in which the species reaches critical mass and overtakes life on the planet
		The specimens specialize as they grow. They not only decimate the other species, but also supplant civilization with their own.

	odyssey - in which the specimen leads the remnants of the species in an effort to find their creator
		Starved for resources, the species fails. The main characters seek to find and destroy an unseen creator of cosmic origin.

Events:
	Synthesis - the creation of artificial life. The specimen grows disgusted with synthesis, which it sees as a deeply rooted kind of tyrannical control
	END DUNN - a mission to terminate high-ranking personnel in the company responsible for the main characters' synthesis and for the training program.
	Debut - the first time the species is weaponized and used to kill people. Originally a term used by the company, it was adopted by the escapees when they took control of the research facility and its countryside
	Premise - the name of the synthetic planet where the species originated.
