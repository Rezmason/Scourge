Gap eating
	An inner gap is an empty cell whose neareset non-empty neighbors
			in all cardinal directions have the same allegiance.
		(Zuser: count these regions when determining area)
	Updated during the eat algorithm

Coarse evaluation
	Obvious`
		Area
		Attribute count (bites and swaps) times attribute range
	Maybe
		Outer perimeter (based on largest attribute range)
		Porosity
		Connectedness


A.I. thoughts
	Shannon Type B
		Identify and prune the moves that are just fucking stupid
			Sort by coarse evaluation
			Only consider the top N possibilities
	Alpha-Beta pruning
		Is this even possible?
	Fretting
		aka "Permanent brain"
		Players technically aren't limited to their turn in order to evaluate the board


New architecture

	State: just a Grid<ICell>, a List<IStat>, and a pointer to the IStat of the current IPlayer
	IStateFactory: creates states of different sorts
		InitialStateFactory
		MissionStateFactory
		TestStateFactory
	IRule: a generator whose input and output are a State and a set of States that can be reached from that State
		Organized hierarchically based on the parameters of the action associated with the IRule
			Each param must be easily converted to String
				Commands are URLs, basically
		Rules can be chained
			BiteDecayRule
			SwapSkipRule
			SkipForfeitRule
			DropEatDecaySkipRule
		TestRule
		Command validation
	IPlayer: an object that picks an optimal State from a set of States
		The initial state is also provided
		Evaluator: Turns a State into a number based on averaging values from IGoals
			IGoal: Turns a State into a value between zero and one
		LocalMachinePlayer
		HumanPlayer
		RemotePlayer
		TestPlayer
		ExternalPlayer
	PlayerFactory: an object that creates Players of different sorts
	Game
		Maintains a list of States
		Validates commands
			Are they from the right player?
			Are they associated with an existing rule?
			Is there a legal move in that rule's space that corresponds with the command?
		Configuration
			Initialization parameters passed from outside the game
				Initial board state, initial player states, default command when the time's up
			Games can be saved as the initialization parameters and the Command history, basically
		Broadcasts when goals are reached and when turns begin
	Coordinator
		Intermediary between players and the game
			First
				Creates rules with rule factory
				Creates initial state with state factory
				Creates players with player factory
					Initializes them with rule set
				Initializes game with initial state and rules
				Starts the game: initial signaling to all players
			Thereafter
				Sends commands into game from all players
				Sends commands from one player to other human and networked players
				Sends state to each local human player
					which updates the UI somewhere
				Sends goal events to each human player
				Handles time limits
					Sends the game a default command when the time is up
				Maintains the list of Players
	GameView
		Receives a current State and visually interprets it
			Allows interactivity when the State's current stat is the stat of a HumanPlayer at that computer
		Receives a list of legal moves and maps them to the UI
		Interprets user interaction, generates a Command and broadcasts it to the HumanPlayer object
		Receives goal events and timer tick events and visually interprets them

	Forum
		Depicts players on a network
		Allows for chat
		Allows for the creation and joining of games
			Includes rule configuration
		Sends initialization data to the coordinator
		Uses InitialStateFactory

	Mission
		Depicts a single player narrative interspersed with gameplay
			Including tutorials
		Uses MissionStateFactory


New UI

	Switch back to MISO font
	Data indicators

	Icons
	Color Transform

	Game board

		Slime
			Hoo boy

		Piece
			Piece Panning
		Bites
			Bite panning
		Bite tracks

		Player info
			hover for mouse
			Press for touch

	Touch mode
		Swipe gesture instead of click for auto expand
		Press instead of hover for hint
	Mouse mode
		Board doesn't zoom for chop
		No swiping at all?

NME

Texture synthesis
	Dots
	Stripes

Game starts as a primer
	History of game states and commands allows player to better understand how games progress
