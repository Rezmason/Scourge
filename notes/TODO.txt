PRAXIS refactor
    Clean up actor, surveyor and builder class functions
    Rules could probably be made in Configs
        Oh. Or in the modules.
    Wait. Are we truly using prev pointers anywhere?!
    Polish the turd till it shines!

1: board cursor, arrow keys
2: board cursor, mouse
3: board cursor, drag and drop
4: snapping
5: "attach" loupe to board cursor's glyphs

Add UIElement to Loupe that "encases" content
Make the border box grow to surround the UIElement, not just the board glyphs

Add loupe sequencing to game presentation
    Display the current piece in the loupe

Shelf

Try replacing Reflect-on-Dynamic with DynamicAccess

Make the bots "use" the SwipeView

There could be WAY more symbols than spaces, and it might look nicer

We can support more Bodies by making IDs dynamic
    Engine, render methods create them from display list

Some Haxe stuff

Minified JS
    -D js_flatten # flatten package namespaces to single variables
    -dce full # remove all unused code
        Problematic; removes constructors that are not explicitly called
            @:keep and @:keepSub
    --no-traces # remove all traces

Flash 12 support
    Context3DBufferUsage
    Context3D::createVertexBuffer

Smarten up the AI
    Prune moves
    Weigh moves
        Negative weights:
            "vulnerability"– susceptability to SOME attack
            "threat"– susceptability to EXISTING attack

Figure out how to do "pain"-related things
    BoardMeasurer updates node distances
    Then RulePresenters get a chance to respond to moves; they get to work with the whole board
Create ripple behavior

Wrap shaders in a soft fuzzy blanket, so they don't fucking piss themselves
    GLSL2AGAL output includes stuff that helps validate parameter setting and so on
    Skim GLSL shaders for this data, too
    We may also get texture indices from here, too

    Flash test - the commented out example output in the metaball post shader should just plain work
    GLSL test - texture indices should no longer be necessary

Separate UIElement from UIScene
    UIScene is a Scene subclass with a UIElement in it, which it resizes to fit itself

Add Metaballs to the game

AGAL2
    Recompile GLSL2AGAL worker
        AGAL_VERSION should be 2
        Recompile latest AGALMiniAssembler into SWC
        Recompile latest GLSL2AGAL SWC

Human players, GUISystem
    Implement abstract commands
    THEN figure out how to connect them to the console
PlayerSystem needs a queue
    IntMap, actually.
    Store all float and move messages whose turns are late
    Iterate through them once they're reached
Improve history
    Make the diffs go backwards
    And force a full commit occasionally
Refactor the console stuff- within reason
    It's a mess
Support output hints

Code review?

Move the logic into a Worker
    Worker tests are failing in-game on Flash and HTML5 targets

Get referee to handle situations where a player takes too long to sync or move
    "Player has been replaced with a bot of Level N"

Timing, continued
    Shot clock
        Animation time should be calculated on the server and added to the shot clock
    Server timeout

Depth of field in frag shader?
    Already got the vZ and deriv

Implement noneuclidean walking and running
    add() function should create heading data
    walk() and run() functions should operate on heading data
    heading data should be available after a walk
    Turtle?

It'd be fun to make a branch that renders glyphs as points

Finalize Praxis classes

Save states and save testing
    If the code for a rule changes, the games that used earlier versions of that rule are kind of botched
    How do other games handle this?

Hey, this game is a Roguelike!
    Figure out what solutions they have to UI challenges

Make renderer cross-platform (as in, test it on several devices)
    Oh boy...

Checksums

Rewrite the eat rule recursion config property to be an Int of depth
    Rather than being recursive or not recursive at all, let the user specify how many recursive steps to take

And then SPEED EVERYTHING UP
    Use timing output to find the bottlenecks
    Lambda.has is expensive - switch to using tables of ids
    Store useful information, like edges, distance and connectedness values
    Rules that take advantage of these values would expand a graph from an affected square
    Just make sure to update this information when it changes
    Take advantage of linked lists for storing sets of nodes
    Also, haxe.List might be better than Array in some situations

ExternalPlayer

Later

    Package Praxis so other people can use it
        Create tic tac toe example for Praxis
        Write munit tests for tic tac toe project
        Create readme and license files for Praxis
        Move Praxis to a haxe lib

    Level Editing - Just a bunch of demiurgic rules

    Lazy board - only represents nodes near players, expands when necessary

    Destination goal rule
    Allow goal rules to apply to specific players

Texture synthesis
    Dots
    Stripes
    Put them on an environmental map
    Use a shader to map the texture onto a blob! :-)
