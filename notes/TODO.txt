Action tests

Game
	Gets rules from rule factory
	Has internal state historian
	Has default command (for when time is up)
	Generates save-states
		Config
		Command history
		Goals
	Broadcasts when goals are reached and when turns begin
	Broadcasts players' commands to one another
	Accepts commands and updates the state
	Validates checksums

Coordinator - connects players to the game
	Has Game
	Has list of Players
		from PlayerFactory
	Has timer
	Communicates between game and players

IPlayer
	TestPlayer
	HumanPlayer
		TextView
			Interprets commands
			Translates all other game events into human readable output
			Use a Flash console component
	LocalMachinePlayer

PlayerFactory
	Generates player lists from config

GameView

Rewrite the eat rule recursion property to be an Int of depth

And then SPEED EVERYTHING UP
	Use timing output to find the bottlenecks
	Lambda.has is expensive - switch to using tables of ids
	Store useful information, like edges, distance and connectedness values
		Rules that take advantage of these values would expand a graph from an affected square
		Just make sure to update this information when it changes
	Take advantage of linked lists for storing sets of nodes
	Also, haxe.List might be better than Array in some situations

RemotePlayer
ExternalPlayer

Coarse evaluation
	Number of nodes (filled and enclosed)
	Attribute count (bites and swaps) times attribute range
	Percentage of nodes that are outer edges!
	Number of nodes


A.I. thoughts
	Shannon Type B
		Identify and prune the moves that are just fucking stupid
			Sort by coarse evaluation
			Only consider the top N possibilities
	Alpha-Beta pruning
		Is this even possible?
	Fretting
		aka "Permanent brain"
		Players technically aren't limited to their turn in order to evaluate the board


Later

	Maybe turn nodes into aspects
		Store their neighbors on them

	Level Editing
		Just a bunch of rules, aha

	Infinite board
		Expand board when placing a piece
		Tough?

	Destination goal rule
	Allow goal rules to apply to specific players


New UI

	Switch back to MISO font
	Data indicators

	Icons
	Color Transform

	Game board

		Slime
			Hoo boy

		Piece
			Piece Panning
		Bites
			Bite panning
		Bite tracks

		Player info
			hover for mouse
			Press for touch

	Touch mode
		Swipe gesture instead of click for auto expand
		Press instead of hover for hint
	Mouse mode
		Board doesn't zoom for chop
		No swiping at all?

Texture synthesis
	Dots
	Stripes
	Put them on an environmental map
	Use a shader to map the texture onto a blob! :-)

Game starts as a primer
	History of game states and commands allows player to better understand how games progress
