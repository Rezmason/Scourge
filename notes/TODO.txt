Biting
	Config
		maxReach
		maxSizeReference
		baseReachOnThickness
		omnidirectional
		biteThroughOccupiedAir
		biteHeads

	Bitten areas MUST be fresh
		The decay rule relies on this

Cavities
	Cavity linked lists on BodyAspects

	Count these regions when determining area (Zuser)
	Updated during the decay algorithm
	Biting through these should be an option
	Tough?

Infinite board
	Expand board when placing a piece
	Tough?

Maybe turn nodes into aspects
	Store their neighbors on them

Make sure to test extras in the state historian

Group rules together!
	Rule groups are updated after rules are updated

Clean up
	Lots of code is used over and over again, especially in rules
	Comment the rule code

And then SPEED EVERYTHING UP
	Use timing output to find the bottlenecks
	Lambda.has is expensive - switch to using tables of ids
	Store useful information, like edges, distance and connectedness values
		Rules that take advantage of these values would expand a graph from an affected square
		Just make sure to update this information when it changes
	Take advantage of linked lists for storing sets of nodes
	Also, haxe.List might be better than Array in some situations

Level Editing
	Just a bunch of rules, aha

New architecture - what's left
	IPlayer: an object that picks an optimal State from a set of States
		The initial state is also provided
		Evaluator: Turns a State into a number based on averaging values from IGoals
			IGoal: Turns a State into a value between zero and one
		LocalMachinePlayer
		HumanPlayer
		RemotePlayer
		TestPlayer
		ExternalPlayer
	PlayerFactory: an object that creates Players of different sorts
	Game
		Maintains a list of States
		Validates commands
			Are they from the right player?
			Are they associated with an existing rule?
			Is there a legal move in that rule's space that corresponds with the command?
		Configuration
			Initialization parameters passed from outside the game
				Initial board state, initial player states, default command when the time's up
			Games can be saved as the initialization parameters and the Command history, basically
		Broadcasts when goals are reached and when turns begin
	Coordinator
		Intermediary between players and the game
			First
				Creates rules with rule factory
				Creates initial state with state factory
				Creates players with player factory
					Initializes them with rule set
				Initializes game with initial state and rules
				Starts the game: initial signaling to all players
			Thereafter
				Sends commands into game from all players
				Sends commands from one player to other human and networked players
				Sends state to each local human player
					which updates the UI somewhere
				Sends goal events to each human player
				Handles time limits
					Sends the game a default command when the time is up
				Maintains the list of Players
	GameView
		Receives a current State and visually interprets it
			Allows interactivity when the State's current stat is the stat of a HumanPlayer at that computer
		Receives a list of legal moves and maps them to the UI
		Interprets user interaction, generates a Command and broadcasts it to the HumanPlayer object
		Receives goal events and timer tick events and visually interprets them

Coarse evaluation
	Number of nodes (filled and enclosed)
	Attribute count (bites and swaps) times attribute range
	Percentage of nodes that are outer edges!
	Number of nodes


A.I. thoughts
	Shannon Type B
		Identify and prune the moves that are just fucking stupid
			Sort by coarse evaluation
			Only consider the top N possibilities
	Alpha-Beta pruning
		Is this even possible?
	Fretting
		aka "Permanent brain"
		Players technically aren't limited to their turn in order to evaluate the board


New UI

	Switch back to MISO font
	Data indicators

	Icons
	Color Transform

	Game board

		Slime
			Hoo boy

		Piece
			Piece Panning
		Bites
			Bite panning
		Bite tracks

		Player info
			hover for mouse
			Press for touch

	Touch mode
		Swipe gesture instead of click for auto expand
		Press instead of hover for hint
	Mouse mode
		Board doesn't zoom for chop
		No swiping at all?

Texture synthesis
	Dots
	Stripes
	Put them on an environmental map
	Use a shader to map the texture onto a blob! :-)

Game starts as a primer
	History of game states and commands allows player to better understand how games progress
