UIText
    System input and output should be InputToken systems

        Caret is now a token index and a char index
            handleBackspace
            handleLeft / handleRight
            handleChar
        No more of this string shit
        Write an inline function that turns an InputToken into a String

Command interpreter
    Generates input and output tokens from input tokens
    Implement everything in "Text view text commands.txt"

Check out the user stories
    Command names "tokenize" after space
        Caret can't enter them, can only delete them
            Deleting them deletes their other text
    Hint text is "tokenized"
        Caret can't *reach* it
    Button text is obvious, fortunately
        Buttons past the "immediate output" are made inactive by UIText

Solidify text update behavior
    If:
        the user WAS at the bottom, or
        the user IS past the bottom, or
        the new text IS the result of interaction,
    -scroll to the new bottom
Scroll indicator (looks like meterstick)

InputStyle use
    UIText keeps track of "input spans"
        The indices of the open tag, the body text and the close tag
    Clicking on an input should move the caret
        Text insertion should be as easy as appending to the input span's text value and recompositing
    Clicking past the line should move the caret to the end of the line
        We need to guarantee that there is always something to click here
    Option-left and option-right should move the caret as well

    Hooks into view somehow; maybe a signal system
