UIText
    Style the tokens differently
        InputStyle
    Token clicking ought to work too
        Clicking on an input token should move the carets
        Shortcuts
        Buttons should become non-interactive when they enter the main text

Implement everything from "Text view text commands.txt" in Interpreter

Solidify text update behavior
    If:
        the user WAS at the bottom, or
        the user IS past the bottom, or
        the new text IS the result of interaction,
    -scroll to the new bottom

Check out the user stories
    Command names "tokenize" after space
        Caret can't enter them, can only delete them
            Deleting them deletes their other text
    Hint text is "tokenized"
        Caret can't *reach* it
    Button text is obvious, fortunately
        Buttons past the "immediate output" are made inactive by UIText

HumanPlayer
    Hooks into view somehow; maybe a signal system
