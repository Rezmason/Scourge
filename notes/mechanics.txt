Game varieties
	Classic
		Heads
		Bites and swaps
		Bites are objects that you can gain by eating
	Genetic powerups
		A looping timeline of powerups received during gameplay
			Small by default; can be made larger
			Indicates current position
			Customized by the player before the game begins
			Visible to other players once game starts

		Genes expressed by unique powers, related to new block:
			Poisonous pieces (kills adjacent enemy blocks for full round) (emergent property: can't be eaten)
			Bitey pieces (Free bite originating from piece at end of turn)
			Head piece (Makes another head)
			Ossified pieces (Spreads through remote parts of your body, killing it– but that region cannot be occupied)
		Tradeoffs
			Non-pieces
			Slower bite replenishment rate
			Slower swap replenishment rate
			More small pieces in swap stream?
		Also
			Ideally, powers are incomparable to one another
				Otherwise, new powers will introduce power creep

	Organs
		Producing spatial patterns within your body
			the presence of those patterns unlocks abilities like voice chat, hints and powerups

	Locomotion
		Necessary for story mode
		Move your head to any part of your body
			The rest of your body is then destroyed
			But your abilities are reset as well

	Domination / Local powerups
		Player wins because they occupy a set of nodes
		Abilities that require that the user inhabits a particular set of nodes

		Sacrificial altars
			A source of plot development and increased power of some sort
			Requires a friend to sacrifice
				(Though them dying is not always necessary)
				Often this friend will be new to the game
				You invite a friend to be your sacrifice on the altar
					They get powers as well, once they start playing
			A grid of nine domination points
				"Signets"
				Rules that specify which state changes to those domination points should occur and in what order
			You and your friend play out an ancient battle
				Your movement on the board should change the states of the signets
					They validate that your retelling of the battle story is accurate
				At the end of the play, the actors who are still alive are rewarded

			Only you know the story– your friend doesn't know the ending
				Maybe– MAYBE– you can trick a friend into dying on the board for the sacrifice

			Why sacrificial altars?
				The altars emphasize the importance of battles, honor and strategy
				More importantly, it's a way for players to introduce their friends to the game
					The stories focus on some core game mechanic as their theme
						Biting or eating or dying
					In essence, I can get players to teach new players how to play for free
						And because it's another person– one you already trust– it'll be more engaging than any tutorial
						And it's in a scenario where the teaching player's skills are not rewarded

	Baton
		A system for transitioning between a turn-based game and an RTS game
		Players who have a baton can act
		Some actions involve passing the baton to other players
			Turn-based game– one player has a baton
			RTS game– every player has a baton

		In both varieties of play, the baton is passed to the next player that doesn't have one

		Turn-based game --> RTT : a rule that duplicates batons as they are passed

		RTT --> Turn-based game : a rule that removes batons instead of passing them until only one is left

		In Scourge, batons are most important during shifts from skirmishes to explorative gameplay
			Game and Referee need to be changed to support batons
				@player PlyAspect.HAS_BATON replaces PlyAspect.CURRENT_PLAYER
					Lots of rules will need to change, too
