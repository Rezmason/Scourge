Game varieties
	Classic
		Heads
		Bites and swaps
		Bites are objects that you can gain by eating
	Genetic powerups
		A looping timeline of powerups received during gameplay
			Small by default; can be made larger
			Indicates current position
			Customized by the player before the game begins
			Visible to other players once game starts

		Genes expressed by unique powers, related to new block:
			Poisonous pieces (kills adjacent enemy blocks for full round) (emergent property: can't be eaten)
			Bitey pieces (Free bite originating from piece at end of turn)
			Head piece (Makes another head)
			Ossified pieces (Spreads through remote parts of your body, killing itâ€“ but that region cannot be occupied)
		Tradeoffs
			Non-pieces
			Slower bite replenishment rate
			Slower swap replenishment rate
			More small pieces in swap stream?
		Also
			Ideally, powers are incomparable to one another
				Otherwise, new powers will introduce power creep

	Locomotion / organs
		pick up a chunk of yourself and place it somewhere else on your body
			Necessary for story mode
		This allows players to sculpt themselves; creating organs could unlock abilities like voice chat, hints and powerups

	Domination / Local powerups
		Player wins because they occupy a set of nodes
		Abilities that require that the user inhabits a particular set of nodes
