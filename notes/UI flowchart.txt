    10 say who is playing
    20 say whose turn it is
    30 say what actions they may take - interactive(action)
    40 prompt:
        players
            list of who is playing (note the current player, and the players who are dead) - interactive(append to msg)
        msg (players, string)
            send a chat message to the listed players. Default is everybody
        action (name)
            1-option action: perform action of that name, goto 50
            many-option action: auto-complete includes parameter bracket
        action (name, param1, param2... paramN)
            Each param has a character limit, like [0-9]+ or [0-9a-zA-Z]+
            If the cursor is in a param, it's hilighted
                backspace clears the param
                Invalid text puts a red X at the end
            Let's see:
                forfeit (double)
                skip (double)
                drop (node, offset, rotation, reflection)
                swap/pickPiece
                bite (node, bitNodes)
        stats
            details about player statistics - body size, bite size, etc

    50 perform action:
        use game annotations to narrate state changes
    60 if game's over, declare winner, else goto 20
