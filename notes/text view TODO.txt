UI object

    ButtonStyle extends AnimatedStyle
        µ{up:upBasis, over:overBasis, down:downBasis}
        Ignore phase and frames
        Period now refers to the time it takes to transition from one state to another
        Make the acid2 eyes into buttons that trace "left" and "right"
    InputStyle extends Animated
        «{hint:hintBasis, valid:validBasis, invalid:invalidBasis}
        Make the acid2 "Hello World!" a field
            Hitting enter should trace the field's contents

    Allow styles to be preserved, instead of remaking them
        Reference styles only

Keyboard interaction
    Just another Interaction type

Solidify text update behavior
        If the user was at the bottom, the text should scroll to the new bottom
        Otherwise, if the new text is the result of interaction, scroll to the new bottom
        Otherwise, stay the fuck put
            I think this will happen no matter what?

Board object

Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
    On mouse/finger up after a drag (once there's no inertia)
    On button click/tap
    On first mouse move after a keystroke
