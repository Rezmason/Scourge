Note: debugging webgl target with the console open slows it down
    Use Chrome instead

AGAL target
    Interaction
        Something in PrettyMethod is preventing MouseMethod from working right

    Performance tweaking
        Body.update
        VertexBuffer3D.uploadFromVector

    Ask wighawag for permission
        Or just dissolve the thing entirely.

UI object

    Allow declared styles to be preserved, instead of remaking them
        This hopefully fixes the bug where animations pause or reset when you drag around the text

    Defer text changes until after dragging

Keyboard interaction
    Just another Interaction type

Back to UI object

    InputStyle extends DynamicStyle
        Â«
        hint, valid, invalid, transitionSpeed
        Make the acid2 "Hello World!" a field
            Hitting enter should trace the field's contents

    Solidify text update behavior
        If:
            the user WAS at the bottom, or
            the user IS past the bottom, or
            the new text IS the result of interaction,
        -scroll to the new bottom
    Scroll indicator (looks like meterstick)

Board object
    Move rotation logic into TestBody before cloning
        Click'n'drag
    Mock State
    Nodes to glyphs
    Instant text changes (for UI, for instance)
    Throb map
    Creeping text
    Dialer
        Dispatches interactions

OpenFL native targets
    resizing window and calling GL.drawElements crashes
    no readPixels

Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
    On mouse/finger up after a drag (once there's no inertia)
    On button click/tap
    On first mouse move after a keystroke

Multiple font support?
    Context3D.setSamplerStateAt

Instancing?
    Maybe colors can be passed in as vecs
