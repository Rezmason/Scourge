Scissor should be optional

UI object

    Inline text styling and components
        Glyph styles
            There aren't many of them in a body, so they can afford to be complicated
            They must represent each stylistic trait of a glyph

        {{prop:-1234.5, name:"NAME"}}
        {{NAME}} = reference to NAME
            {{}} is the default, naturally

        These can be defined at the top of the document and then used by name

    Button style
    Field style

Unify test body, UI body, alphabet body with Body
    Lots of similarities once again

Board object

Interaction
    Make sure interaction IDs work

    Mouse interaction model: Roll over, roll out, mouse down, mouse up, mouse up out

    Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
        On mouse/finger up after a drag
        On button click/tap
        On first mouse move after a keystroke
    Only color and draw the hoverable/clickable objects, of course
        Create a large quad object for the board's draggable hit area
