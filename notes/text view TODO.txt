UI object

    Maybe isolate scrolling behavior

    Style tags should support ranges for animation
        a:[0.5, 1]
        Animation code uses minimum range length

    Style tags should support mouse states
        MouseStyle extends Style
            µ{up:upBasis, over:overBasis, down:downBasis}
        InputStyle extends Style
            «{hint:hintBasis, valid:validBasis, invalid:invalidBasis}

    Styles should be polled for text interaction

    Button style
    Field style



Unify test body, UI body, alphabet body with Body
    Lots of similarities once again

Board object

Interaction
    Make sure interaction IDs work

    Mouse interaction model: Roll over, roll out, mouse down, mouse up, mouse up out

    Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
        On mouse/finger up after a drag
        On button click/tap
        On first mouse move after a keystroke
    Only color and draw the hoverable/clickable objects, of course
        Create a large quad object for the board's draggable hit area
