UI object

    Snappy scrollin'
        (if dragging)
            If dragEnd < 0,
                dragEnd = spring(-dragEnd)
            else if dragEnd > max,
                dragEnd = max + spring(dragEnd - max)

        (Move min, max to ratio call again)

        (when let go)
            if dragEnd < 0,
                scroll to 0
            else if dragEnd > max,
                scroll to max

    ButtonStyle extends AnimatedStyle
        µ{up:upBasis, over:overBasis, down:downBasis}
        Ignore phase and frames
        Period now refers to the time it takes to transition from one state to another
        Make the acid2 eyes into buttons that trace "left" and "right"
    InputStyle extends Animated
        «{hint:hintBasis, valid:validBasis, invalid:invalidBasis}
        Make the acid2 "Hello World!" a field
            Hitting enter should trace the field's contents

    Allow styles to be preserved, instead of remaking them
        Reference styles only

Keyboard interaction
    Just another Interaction type

Back to UI object
    Solidify text update behavior
        If the user was at the bottom, the text should scroll to the new bottom
        Otherwise, if the new text is the result of interaction, scroll to the new bottom
        Otherwise, stay the fuck put
            I think this will happen no matter what?

    Scroll indicator (looks like meterstick)

Board object
    Move rotation logic into TestBody before cloning
        Click'n'drag
    Mock State
    Nodes to glyphs
    Instant text changes (for UI, for instance)
    Throb map
    Creeping text
    Dialer
        Dispatches interactions



Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
    On mouse/finger up after a drag (once there's no inertia)
    On button click/tap
    On first mouse move after a keystroke

Multiple font support?
    Context3D.setSamplerStateAt
