UI object

    Clean it up and encapsulate some of its contents
        And the function names are horrendous

    Button style
    Field style



Unify test body, UI body, alphabet body with Body
    Lots of similarities once again

Board object

Interaction
    Make sure interaction IDs work

    Mouse interaction model: Roll over, roll out, mouse down, mouse up, mouse up out

    Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
        On mouse/finger up after a drag
        On button click/tap
        On first mouse move after a keystroke
    Only color and draw the hoverable/clickable objects, of course
        Create a large quad object for the board's draggable hit area
