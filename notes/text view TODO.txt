Null object reference in BitePieceRule!
RandomFunction fails when it's set to Math.random??

NodeView and BoardBody

    Character scaling for large games

    Throb
        A wave pool whose width is the longest distance from a player's head to their tail
            It's easy to expand and contract the wave pool
        The view nodes look up the propagation data for their distance value

    Basics
        handleBoardUpdate function
            Each node view checks for a change in board state
                Includes connectivity pass
            (Narratological cues would happen here, like stress level and text unlock)
        handleUIUpdate function
            Interpret UI state
            Check each UI for a change in state
        updateAnimation
            (for propagating waves along slimes' bodies)
        Dialer animation
            Dispatches keyboard interactions
    Orchestrate changes in the game
        Test that board state is properly handled


Command interpreter

UI object

    InputStyle use
        UIText keeps track of "input spans"
            The indices of the open tag, the body text and the close tag
        Clicking on an input should move the caret
            Text insertion should be as easy as appending to the input span's text value and recompositing
        Clicking past the line should move the caret to the end of the line
            We need to guarantee that there is always something to click here
        Option-left and option-right should move the caret as well

    Solidify text update behavior
        If:
            the user WAS at the bottom, or
            the user IS past the bottom, or
            the new text IS the result of interaction,
        -scroll to the new bottom
    Scroll indicator (looks like meterstick)

OpenFL native targets
    resizing window and calling GL.drawElements crashes
    no readPixels

Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
    On mouse/finger up after a drag (once there's no inertia)
    On button click/tap
    On first mouse move after a keystroke

Multiple font support?
    Context3D.setSamplerStateAt

Instancing?
    Maybe colors can be passed in as vecs
