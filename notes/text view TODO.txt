Interaction
    Make sure interaction IDs work

    Mouse interaction model: Roll over, roll out, mouse down, mouse up, mouse up out

    Render the scene ONCE each time interaction changes
        On mouse/finger up after a drag
        On button click/tap
        On first mouse move after a keystroke
    Only color and draw the hoverable/clickable objects, of course
        Create a large quad object for the board's draggable hit area
